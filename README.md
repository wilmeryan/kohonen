## Kohonen Self Organising Map

This repo contains two implementation of Kohonen's Self Organising Map. The first is implemented in a vectorized way in numpy. The second implementation adds Numba JIT support which significantly speeds up the numpy code by automatically optimizing it. 

Please see Solution.ipynb for a quick profiling and demostration and src/ for source code and tests.
